            <p className="py-2">
              JavaZone is the biggest community-driven Java conference that has
              been organized in Oslo, Norway since 2001. It is organized on a
              voluntary basis by a group of people from javaBin, the Norwegian
              Java User Group, working around the year and putting many hours to
              create an amazing conference experience for you.
            </p>
            <p className="py-2">
              Our goal is to organize a community-driven conference for
              developers where they can learn new things, share knowledge, and
              socialize. We are happy to see the event grow bigger and better
              every year. In 2024 we hosted over 3600 participants and 188
              speakers across 8 parallel tracks over the course of two days. In
              addition, we also offered a selection of 13 workshops held on the
              day before the conference started.

            <p className="py-2">
              Organizing a conference of this size on a voluntary basis is a lot
              of hard work (and it is great fun too!). The conference
              organization is represented by the JavaZone Core Team ‚Äì a group of
              main organizers of the conference, where each representative is
              responsible for one or several areas or is leading a group of
              other JUG members. An example of such groups can be Program
              Committee, IT systems, etc.

              paid to hold a presentation, and likewise, that no-one can pay us

              Sustainable waste management and recycling at JavaZone ‚ôªÔ∏è
            </h2>
            <p className="py-2">
              In an era where environmental consciousness is at the forefront,
              responsible waste management practices have become imperative. At
              Oslo Spektrum, an innovative partnership with Oslo Municipality
              and Franzefoss ensures that waste is not just disposed of, but
              actively sorted and recycled, promoting a greener future.
            </p>
            <p className="py-2">
              Upon entering JavaZone, attendees may not be immediately aware of
              the meticulous waste management system that operates behind the
              scenes. Once waste is discarded, the process of responsible
              disposal begins. A comprehensive sorting mechanism is in place,
              designed to separate recyclables from non-recyclable materials.
              One notable aspect of this waste management initiative is the
              sorting and collection of beverage containers for deposit refund,
              known as "pant" in Norway. The bottles and cans are systematically
              collected, sorted, and sent for recycling, embodying the ethos of
              resource efficiency.
            </p>
            <h3 className="py-2 font-bold">Where does it all end up?</h3>
            <p className="py-2">
              Considerable portions of waste generated during JavaZone are
              earmarked for recycling. Through a blend of advanced waste
              separation technology and dedicated staff, materials like paper,
              plastic, glass, and metal are carefully segregated. The residual
              waste is further sorted at the Franzefoss plant in Haraldsrud and
              the remaining 70% is ground up and converted into FOB (refined
              waste fuel). Franzefoss has an agreement with Norcem for the
              delivery of FOB and this is used by Norcem as a high-value fuel
              for cement production. The food waste/wet organic waste delivered
              is used for biogas and fertilizer on grain fields. This not only
              reduces the environmental impact of JavaZone but also sets an
              example for attendees and the wider community.
