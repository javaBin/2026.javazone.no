            Increase the chance of your talk being accepted
          </h2>

          <p>
            There is generally a very high correlation between how much work one
            puts into the creation of a proposal and the chance that the
            proposal is accepted. Even a proposal with an extremely cool theme,
            entertaining title, and an experienced speaker may be excluded if
            the description is lacking.

          <p>
            We have gathered some tips that should be considered when writing a
            JavaZone proposal, and a few reasons why proposals may be rejected.

            <p className="mt-4">
              The title is the first thing people will see. A poorly worded
              title may be the only thing many will see of your proposal. A good
              title is catchy and concise, and should describe what you will
              talk about.

            <p className="mt-4">
              The abstract is what will be featured in the JavaZone program for
              the public to read. If the program committee doesn't believe that
              the abstract is good enough to convince people to come to your
              presentation, then the proposal won't be accepted.

              The outline is your chance to pitch the proposal to the program
              committee. This section will not be published, but if your outline
              is thin or just a copy of your abstract, then you're not selling
              yourself well.

            <p className="mt-4">
              With an exciting theme, it's easy to find many things one wants to
              present. Don't get carried away. Your proposal outline should
              explain how you will cover everything in a clear and structured
              manner.

              If you've held the talk before, then please include links to any
              supporting material that you can show us. This could be video
              recordings, slide decks, blog posts, GitHub repositories, photos,
              etc. Video recordings of any less related talks of yours may also
              give us an impression of how you are as a speaker.

              Nothing says you haven't put much effort into your proposals like
              a submission form filled with 'TODO' or 'TBD' in the required
              fields. This is fine for the initial submission, but please make
              sure the required information is filled out properly by the
              submission deadline.

              If your proposal is full of typos, it will be noticed (especially
              in key fields such as the title). This isn't a point that will
              necessarily mean the proposal will be rejected, but it doesn't

              Live coding can make a presentation more entertaining, but it also

              the demonstration, then it might hurt your chances to be accepted.

              The program committee reviews hundreds of proposals each year. A

            Even though we are rooting for your talk to be accepted, the fact is

              The program committee was not sure what you're going to present,

              The abstract doesn't convey the feeling that you have put a lot of

            <p className="mt-4">
              10-minute lightning talk proposals that appear to require double
              that time will be discounted. The same applies to proposals that
              try to cover everything possible instead of focusing on a specific
              area. If you want to cover a breadth of material, then be sure to
              convey to us that you have thought through the timeline for your
              talk. We must feel that you believe that it will work, something
              that can be achieved with a clear and detailed outline.

              The abstract was not catchy enough
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-4">
              If the committee ends up with 600 or so proposals to go through,
              time becomes a factor. This is especially true in the first pass,
              and in the early stages. If your abstract catches the fancy of
              just one or more of the committee members, your proposal is likely
              to be thumbs-upped to the next phase. If not, it tends to drop
              out.

            </h3>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Even though JavaZone has a place for many topics, there are some
              proposals that do not fit. Some proposals are rejected because we
              feel the presentation would be better served at a different
              conference.

              If you intend to present with a co-presenter, and they happen to

              We often receive multiple good proposals covering exactly the same

              multiple excellent submissions. Limited space in the program means
              that many of these end up being rejected.
