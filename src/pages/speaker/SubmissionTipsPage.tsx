        <Heading level="h2">Increase the chance of your talk being accepted</Heading>

        <p>
          There is generally a very high correlation between how much work one puts into the creation of a proposal and the chance that the proposal
          is accepted. Even a proposal with an extremely cool theme, entertaining title, and an experienced speaker may be excluded if the description
          is lacking.
        </p>
        <p>We have gathered some tips that should be considered when writing a JavaZone proposal, and a few reasons why proposals may be rejected.</p>

        <Card title="Create a good title" gradientColors={gradients[0]}>
          <p>
            The title is the first thing people will see. A poorly worded title may be the only thing many will see of your proposal. A good title is
            catchy and concise, and should describe what you will talk about.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Write a catchy abstract" gradientColors={gradients[1]}>
          <p>
            The abstract is what will be featured in the JavaZone program for the public to read. If the program committee doesn't believe that the
            abstract is good enough to convince people to come to your presentation, then the proposal won't be accepted.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Provide a detailed outline" gradientColors={gradients[2]}>
          <p>
            The outline is your chance to pitch the proposal to the program committee. This section will not be published, but if your outline is thin
            or just a copy of your abstract, then you're not selling yourself well.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Be concise" gradientColors={gradients[3]}>
          <p>
            With an exciting theme, it's easy to find many things one wants to present. Don't get carried away. Your proposal outline should explain
            how you will cover everything in a clear and structured manner.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Include supporting materials" gradientColors={gradients[4]}>
          <p>
            If you've held the talk before, then please include links to any supporting material that you can show us. This could be video recordings,
            slide decks, blog posts, GitHub repositories, photos, etc. Video recordings of any less related talks of yours may also give us an
            impression of how you are as a speaker.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Fill out all mandatory fields properly" gradientColors={gradients[5]}>
          <p>
            Nothing says you haven't put much effort into your proposals like a submission form filled with 'TODO' or 'TBD' in the required fields.
            This is fine for the initial submission, but please make sure the required information is filled out properly by the submission deadline.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Ask someone to review your proposal" gradientColors={gradients[6]}>
          <p>
            If your proposal is full of typos, it will be noticed (especially in key fields such as the title). This isn't a point that will
            necessarily mean the proposal will be rejected, but it doesn't help your case.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Do you plan on doing live coding? Be sure to describe your plan to us" gradientColors={gradients[7]}>
          <p>
            Live coding can make a presentation more entertaining, but it also increases the chances of something going wrong. If the program
            committee doesn't get the feeling that you have a solid plan for the demonstration, then it might hurt your chances to be accepted.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Send in multiple proposals" gradientColors={gradients[8]}>
          <p>
            If you have multiple things you can talk about, then submitting 2 or 3 different proposals will increase your chances of finding a place
            in the schedule.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="... but please don't spam us" gradientColors={gradients[9]}>
          <p>
            The program committee reviews hundreds of proposals each year. A few well-written proposals are much more valuable than a bucket full of
            half-prepared ideas.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Do not shout" gradientColors={gradients[10]}>
          <p>
            You will definitely be noticed <span className="font-medium">IF YOUR TITLE IS ENTIRELY UPPERCASE (!!!!!!!!)</span>, but not necessarily in
            a positive way.
          </p>
        </Card>
      </section>

      <section className="text-left max-w-2xl w-full space-y-4">
        <Heading level="h2">Why was my talk rejected?</Heading>
        <p>
          Even though we are rooting for your talk to be accepted, the fact is that some talks must be rejected. Read through these tips to understand
          why this might happen. Even better, if you are reading this before the Call for Speakers deadline, you can go through your proposal and make
          sure you do your best to avoid these common pitfalls.
        </p>

        <Card title="Not enough information" gradientColors={gradients[11]}>
          <p>
            The program committee was not sure what you're going to present, or there was not enough information about the technology/things you want
            to talk about to decide how great the presentation will be.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="The proposal is too thin" gradientColors={gradients[12]}>
          <p>The abstract doesn't convey the feeling that you have put a lot of work into it, or that you have thought through your presentation.</p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="You want to talk about more than we think you will have time to cover" gradientColors={gradients[13]}>
          <p>
            10-minute lightning talk proposals that appear to require double that time will be discounted. The same applies to proposals that try to
            cover everything possible instead of focusing on a specific area. If you want to cover a breadth of material, then be sure to convey to us
            that you have thought through the timeline for your talk. We must feel that you believe that it will work, something that can be achieved
            with a clear and detailed outline.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="The abstract was not catchy enough" gradientColors={gradients[14]}>
          <p>
            If the committee ends up with 600 or so proposals to go through, time becomes a factor. This is especially true in the first pass, and in
            the early stages. If your abstract catches the fancy of just one or more of the committee members, your proposal is likely to be
            thumbs-upped to the next phase. If not, it tends to drop out.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="The theme did not fit in with what we want to include in the program this year" gradientColors={gradients[15]}>
          <p>
            Even though JavaZone has a place for many topics, there are some proposals that do not fit. Some proposals are rejected because we feel
            the presentation would be better served at a different conference.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="Your co-presenter had a different proposal accepted" gradientColors={gradients[16]}>
          <p>
            If you intend to present with a co-presenter, and they happen to have had a separate proposal already accepted, then we may have to reject
            your joint proposal.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card title="You were unlucky" gradientColors={gradients[17]}>
          <p>
            We often receive multiple good proposals covering exactly the same topic. The program committee then has to decide between these multiple
            excellent submissions. Limited space in the program means that many of these end up being rejected.
